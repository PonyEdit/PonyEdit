.SH NAME
libssh2_userauth_keyboard_interactive_ex - authenticate a session using a challenge-response authentication
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libssh2.h>

int
libssh2_userauth_keyboard_interactive_ex(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, const char *username, unsigned int username_len, LIBSSH2_USERAUTH_KBDINT_RESPONSE_FUNC(*response_callback));

int
libssh2_userauth_keyboard_interactive(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, const char *username, LIBSSH2_USERAUTH_KBDINT_RESPONSE_FUNC(*response_callback));

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsession\fP - Session instance as returned by 
.BR libssh2_session_init_ex(3)

\fIusername\fP - Name of user to attempt plain password authentication for.

\fIusername_len\fP - Length of username parameter.

\fIresponse_callback\fP - As authentication proceeds, host issues several (1 or more) challenges and requires responses. This callback will be called at this moment. Callback is responsible to obtain responses for the challenges, fill the provided data structure and then return control. Responses will be sent to the host. String values will be free(3)ed by the library.

Attempts keyboard-interactive (challenge/response) authentication.

Note that many SSH servers will always issue single "password" challenge,
requesting actual password as response, but it is not required by the protocol,
and various authentication schemes, such as smartcard authentication may use
keyboard-interactive authentication type too.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Return 0 on success or negative on failure.  It returns
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.

.SH ERRORS
\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_ALLOC\fP -  An internal memory allocation call failed.

\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_SEND\fP - Unable to send data on socket.

\fLIBSSH2_ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED\fP -  failed, invalid username/password or public/private key.
